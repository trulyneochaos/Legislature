# Conclave Name Renaming Act 

Whereas the present name of the channel for public governance is deemed to be inaccurate. Per Merriam Webster’s Dictionary, conclave: a private meeting or secret assembly. However as this is the most public governance channel, the name is inadequate to describe it.

### Section I Proposed Method of Renaming
A ranked-choice vote shall be conducted among members of the Upper and Lower Councils.
All council members in good standing shall be eligible to vote. The option receiving a majority after ranked tabulation shall be adopted as the official name. Additional name proposals may be submitted prior to the opening of the ballot.
